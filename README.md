# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-Using-python
Here, I have create a CNN model that is trained to predict the whether a set of images is from english alphabet or not.
There exists an already trained model with an accuracy score of about 80%, anyone interested can check out that model.


Directions:
1 - First Extract that Img and Imgmodel files in the same directory where you kept the .ipynb file.
2 - sequentially load the codes and check out the model.
